EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW:
   
        The High Energy Physics Group, led by Dr. Shuichi Kunori at Texas Tech University, has created a portable prototype muon ray telescope which in the experiment is used to measure the muon flux at any given angle. Our experiment concerns with the use of this telescope to create tomographical images; we point the telescope towards a Water Tower located at the Reese Technology Center and record the muon flux for a period of time. Using this data and the known behavior of muon physics, we generate a shadow image of the water tower. This image gives us information of the structural integrity of the water tower, which basically means we can infer the different materials used in the construction of the tower and the level of water inside the tower.

PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS:

        The purpose of this program is to create a pdf analysis report of the data we recorded during our experintal run and the tomographic image. This program uses OOP principles to create physical objects from the raw data. We use the analysis report to diagnose the health of our telescope and debug any problems if the results don't match with the monte carlo simulation.
